# API of Your Choice
API of Your Choice is an extension of the Class of Your Choice assignment from Module 1. In this assignment, we'll be taking the class we made previously and creating an EntityFramework table that contains it, along with some API actions that allow our data to be accessed by other applications if needed. 

## Setup
- Create a .NET API Application in Visual Studio.
- Create a new class, named the same as from the Class of Your Choice assignment, and then copy over the properties, constructor, and methods into this file.

## Instructions
Create an EntityFramework First, create an Create an API Controller with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods for your class. 

## Grading
A Passing grade will be based on the following criteria:

- Your console app compiles and runs without error.
- Tests are optional.
- You have added a class that includes the following:

   - at least 5 properties that are used within your application

   - at least 3 methods that are called within your application (NOTE: methods that Get or Set properties do not count toward the 3 method minimum)

   - An interface that allows the user to interact with all of an object's methods, and the option to continue interacting or exit.
